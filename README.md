# README Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to generate a README file from node.js. In this project I learned how to create prompts from the user and then learned how to write a file after the application has been initialized.  

## Installation

In order to use the README generator the user first needs to install the packages by performing npm install.  After the packages have been installed the user must enter node index.js which will start the application.

## Usage

After the packages have been installed and the application has been initialized the user must answer the following prompts. 

-What is the title of your project?
-Please provide a description of the what, why, and how of your project.
-Please provide a table of contents for your project.
-What are the steps required to install your project?
-Provide instructions and examples for use.
-List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. If
 you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
-Please provide a link to your GitHub repository.
-Please provide your email address so that I can reach out to you.
-Please enter the type of license for your project

After the prompts have been answered the README.md file will be generated.
